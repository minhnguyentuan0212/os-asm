# Simple Operating System Design

## Overview
This project aims to simulate a simple operating system (OS) to provide fundamental insights into Scheduling, Synchronization, and Memory Management. It showcases the implementation of a Scheduler using Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) algorithm and Memory Management techniques including Paging.

## Team Members
- Nguyễn Tuấn Minh (Memory Management & Report)
- Hoàng Đức Nguyên (Scheduling & Report)

## Features
- **Multilevel Feedback Queue Scheduler:** Dynamically adjusts the priority of processes based on their execution characteristics, preventing starvation and ensuring fairness among processes.
- **Memory Management:** Implements paging-based memory management, supporting virtual memory for each process, and a paging-based address translation scheme.

## Built With
- C programming language for core OS simulation components.
- Python for scripting and automation of testing.
- GNU Make for automating the compilation process.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- GCC compiler or any compatible C compiler.
- Python (for running simulation scripts).
- Make tool (for building the project).
